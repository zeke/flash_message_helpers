h1. Flash Message Helpers

This Rails plugin provides helpers for generating and displaying flash messages. 

h1. Installation

@script/plugin install git@github.com:zeke/flash_message_helpers.git@

h2. Usage (Controllers)

The controller helper smartly generates flash messages based on the object you give it, its attributes, and the current controller method. Use it in your create, update, and destroy methods.

<code>flash_changes(@sandwich)</code>

If @sandwich was just created, you'll get a message like this:

_Sandwich *The Submarine* was successfully created._

If is was updated, you get:

_Sandwich *The Submarine* was successfully updated._

If is was delted, you get:

_Sandwich *The Submarine* was successfully deleted._

This method assumes that your object has one of the following attributes: @name@, @title@, @permalink@, or @id@. If it doesn't, no name will be displayed in the flash message. Or you can pass in a custom name attribute like so:

<code>flash_changes(@sandwich, :name => 'Grinder')</code>

h2. Usage (Views)

Put this in @application.html.erb@:

@<%= render_flash_messages %>@

h2. TODO

* Add an option to linkify the object in the flash message, accounting for the possibility of nest routes.
* Humanize model name in flash_changes method, so things like BigBadModel end up as 'Big Bad Model'
