h1. Flash Message Helpers

This Rails plugin provides helpers for generating and displaying flash messages.

h1. Installation

@script/plugin install git@github.com:zeke/flash_message_helpers.git@

h2. Usage (Controllers)

Use the following in the @create@ and @update@ methods of your controllers:

<code>flash_changes(@sandwich)</code>

If @sandwich was just created, you'll get a message like this:

_Sandwich *The Submarine* was successfully created._

If is was just updated, you get:

_Sandwich *The Submarine* was successfully updated._

This method assumes that your object has a @name@ or @title@ attribute. If it doesn't, no name will be displayed in the flash message. To pass in a custom name attribute, do the following:

<code>flash_changes(@sandwich, @sandwich.special_name)</code>

h2. Usage (Views)

Put this is your application view:

@<%= render_flash_messages %>@

h2. TODO

* Add a method for creating flash messages for deleted objects
